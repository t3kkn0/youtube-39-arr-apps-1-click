# Arr-Stack: Your Automated Media Server

Welcome to Arr-Stack! This project provides a comprehensive, pre-configured media automation stack using Docker. It handles everything from downloading to organizing your movies, TV shows, and anime, all managed by a simple, user-friendly script.

This guide will walk you through the entire process, from installation to final configuration.

## Core Features

The included management script automates almost everything for you:

* **One-Line Installation:** A single command downloads the manager and starts the setup.
* **Menu-Driven Interface:** No need to memorize complex Docker commands. Just choose an option from the menu.
* **Guided Setup:** The script handles creating folders, setting permissions, and managing configuration files.
* **Safe Operations:** Before potentially destructive actions like uninstalling or updating, the script will offer to create a backup of your settings for easy recovery.
* **Easy Management:** Reloading, updating, viewing logs, and other maintenance tasks are all available as simple menu options.

## Step 1: Installation

Getting started is as simple as running one command. Open your server's terminal, paste the following line, and press Enter.

```bash
curl -L -o manage-arr.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t3kkn0/Arr-Stack/main/manage-arr.sh && chmod +x manage-arr.sh && sudo ./manage-arr.sh
```

This command will:
1.  Download the latest version of the management script (`manage-arr.sh`).
2.  Make it executable.
3.  Run it with `sudo` (required for Docker and file management).

You will then be greeted by the main menu, where you will select **Option 1: Install Stack** to begin the guided setup.

## Step 2: Using the Management Menu

Once installed, you can run `sudo ./manage-arr.sh` at any time to access the main menu. Hereâ€™s what each option does:

* **1. Install Stack:** Performs the initial installation. It clones the project, sets up your `.env` configuration file, prepares NAS folders, and starts all the services. If you already have a backup, you'll be offered the chance to restore it here.
* **2. Uninstall Stack:** Stops and removes the application containers. It will ask you if you want to keep your application data (safer) or delete it completely. It will also offer to create a final backup before deleting anything.
* **3. Reload Stack:** This is how you update your stack. It pulls the latest application images and configuration from GitHub and restarts your services. It will offer to create a backup before it starts, just in case an update causes issues.
* **4. Backup Configuration:** Manually creates a full backup of your local application settings and your `.env` file to your NAS.
* **5. Restore Configuration:** Restores your settings from a previously created backup. This is great for migrating to a new server or recovering from an error.
* **6. View Live Logs:** Shows you the real-time logs from all running applications, which is useful for troubleshooting.
* **7. Prune Docker System:** A housekeeping tool to remove unused Docker data and free up disk space.
* **8. DESTROY Config Folders:** A highly destructive option that completely removes all local application data. Use with extreme caution.

## Step 3: Initial Application Setup

After the stack is running, you need to configure each application to work together.

> **IMPORTANT NETWORKING NOTE:**
> When one application needs to talk to another (e.g., connecting Sonarr to qBittorrent), you **must use your server's main IP address** (`10.20.10.52`). Do not use `localhost`.

### **qBittorrent (Download Client)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:8080`

1.  **Find Temp Password:** The first time you run the stack, a temporary password is created. Check the logs to get it by choosing **Option 6** in the manager menu. The username is `admin`.
2.  **Log In & Change Password:** Go to `Tools -> Options... -> Web UI` and set a new, permanent username and password.
3.  **Set Download Paths:** Go to the `Downloads` tab:
    * **Default Save Path:** `/downloads/complete`
    * Check **Keep incomplete torrents in:** and set the path to `/downloads/incomplete`
4.  Click **Save**.

### **Prowlarr (Indexer Manager)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:9696`

1.  **Setup:** Set a username and password on first launch.
2.  **Add Download Client:**
    * Go to `Settings -> Download Clients` and click `+` to add a new one.
    * Choose **qBittorrent**.
    * **Host:** `10.20.10.52`
    * **Port:** `8080`
    * Enter the username and password you just set for qBittorrent.
    * Click `Test` to ensure it works, then `Save`.
3.  **Add Indexers:** Go to the `Indexers` page and add your preferred torrent indexer sites.

### **Sonarr (for TV Shows)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:8989`

1.  **Connect Download Client:** Go to `Settings -> Download Clients`, add qBittorrent, and configure it exactly as you did in Prowlarr (using the server IP).
2.  **Add Root Folder:** Go to `Settings -> Media Management` and add a Root Folder pointing to `/tv`.
3.  **Connect to Prowlarr:** Go to `Settings -> Indexers`, click `+`, choose `Add Indexer from Prowlarr`, and follow the prompts.

### **Sonarr-Anime (for Anime)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:8990`

1.  **Connect Download Client:** Repeat the same steps as the first Sonarr to connect to qBittorrent.
2.  **CRITICAL ANIME SETTING:** Go to `Settings -> Media Management`. Click **"Show Advanced"** at the top. Under the "Series" section, change the **Series Type** from "Standard" to **"Anime"**. This is essential for correct processing.
3.  **Add Root Folder:** Add a Root Folder pointing to `/anime`.
4.  **Connect to Prowlarr:** Connect this Sonarr instance to Prowlarr just like you did with the first one.

### **Radarr (for Movies)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:7878`
* Follow the same logic as Sonarr: connect your download client (qBittorrent via server IP), set your Root Folder to `/movies`, and connect to Prowlarr for indexers.

### **Emby (Media Server)**

* **URL:** `http://10.20.10.52:8096`

1.  **First-Time Setup:** Walk through the initial setup wizard to create your admin user.
2.  **Add Your Libraries:**
    * In the Emby dashboard, go to `Settings (the gear icon) -> Library`.
    * Click **+ Add Library**.
    * **For TV Shows:** Select "TV Shows," name it "TV Shows," and add the folder path `/data/tvshows`.
    * **For Movies:** Select "Movies," name it "Movies," and add the folder path `/data/movies`.
    * **For Anime:** Select "TV Shows," name it "Anime," and add the folder path `/data/anime`.
